## Test Configuration

### System Under Test
- **Application:** WCAGAI v3.0 Backend
- **Version:** 3.0.0
- **Environment:** [Production/Staging/Development]
- **Server Specs:** [CPU cores, RAM, Disk]
- **Date:** [Test Date]
- **Tester:** [Name/Team]

### Test Parameters
- **Duration:** [e.g., 3600 seconds (1 hour)]
- **Concurrency Level:** [e.g., 5 concurrent workers]
- **Target Vertical:** [e.g., all / ecommerce / news]
- **Total Test URLs:** [e.g., 100 unique URLs]
- **Expected Scans:** [Estimated total scans]

---

## Test Methodology

### Test Design

The stress test performs continuous accessibility scans using the following approach:

1. **Worker Pool:** N concurrent workers (configurable)
2. **URL Rotation:** Workers cycle through a predefined list of URLs
3. **Error Handling:** Failed scans are logged but don't stop the test
4. **Metrics Collection:** Real-time tracking of performance metrics
5. **Graceful Shutdown:** Test runs for exact duration then completes

### URL Selection

URLs are organized into 10 industry verticals:
- E-commerce (10 URLs)
- News & Media (10 URLs)
- Education (10 URLs)
- Technology (10 URLs)
- Social Media (10 URLs)
- Finance (10 URLs)
- Travel (10 URLs)
- Entertainment (10 URLs)
- Health (10 URLs)
- Government (10 URLs)

### Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Success Rate | >95% | >90% |
| Average Scan Time | <5s | <10s |
| Memory Growth | <10% | <20% |
| Error Rate | <5% | <10% |
| Throughput | >5 scans/min | >3 scans/min |
